tx path may panic kernel
SMP support is buggy
PCMCIA support? Does it work for you?
USB support is broken, additionaly detaching device will panic or deadlock kernel
It should be possible to load Windows(r) drivers directly - no need to create kernel module via ndisgen(8)
Auto roaming is broken: if association timeouts we may be in ASSOC state forever - add callout?
Some vendors publish useless .INF files. NDISulator cannot create device then.
Suspend/Resume support? Does device still work after suspend/resume?
Improve and test: wpa_supplicant -Dbsd
Support 6.X NDIS API
